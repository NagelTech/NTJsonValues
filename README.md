NTJsonValues
============

NSDictionary Category to aid parsing JSON values.

This category eases the extraction of JSON values from NSDictionaries. Methods support key paths and do automatic conversion to the requested type. (For instance if you request an integer and the server returned a string it will be automatically converted. This will help your JSON parsing code to be more robust and handle errors smoothly.

See the quick help or NSDictionary+NTJsonValues.h for method documentation.
